      'Walang Makakatigil: How Youth and Students are Resisting Repression in the Philippine',
    description:
      'The Filipino youth have a long history of coming together to fight for liberation in the face of oppressive and repressive regimes. Today, young people boldly critiquing President Duterteâ€™s policies in the Philippines are under attack by the current administration. Hear stories from the youth at the front lines of rising repression in the Philippines, and how they are carrying on the legacy of resilience and resistance for a better world.',
